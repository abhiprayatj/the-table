# Supabase Configuration
# 
# This project uses Supabase Cloud for development (no Docker required).
# To use Supabase CLI with cloud projects, link your project:
#   npx supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
#
# Production project ID (from Lovable)
# project_id = "whhgviqeodhhgyskqitc"
#
# For development, create a separate Supabase Cloud project and
# set credentials in .env.local
